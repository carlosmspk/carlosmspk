- 👋 Hi, I’m Carlos!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming overall and at different levels. I like learning new programming languages with your typical "homework" style assignments. I struggle a bit in how I can learn a language AND do something practical with it, so I tend to try and learn it before actually using it for anything useful. I tend to try and learn different areas of development, but task automation and scripting have been something I've been always prone to do.
- 🌱 I’m currently deep-diving in web dev. I already have a solid understanding of it, but I'm trying to diversify frameworks, tech stacks, infrastructure, etc. I'm also trying to improve my Native Android App dev skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects. It's a new world to me that I haven't gotten the chance to participate in.
- 📫 Reach me by email me at carlosmspk@gmail.com if you have proposals, questions, or requests for me! I might take a while to answer, but will eventually get around to it. For more professional-oriented emails, please contact me at carlos_cp_santos@hotmail.com
